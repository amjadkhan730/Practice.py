#Function 
          #Function is block of code disgn to perform a particular task,,, whenever it is called,,,
          
          #There are two type of function
         
         # 1= Built - in function,
                                 #Those function are defined and pre-coded in python,,Some example of built-in function,,
                                 
                                 #min(),,max(),,list(),,sum(),,type(),,print(),,
                                 
         # 2= User defined function,
                            
                                  # We can create function  to specific task as per our needs such function is user defined function,,
                                  
                       #Example
                    
# a = 9
