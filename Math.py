# Python Math=

               #Python has a set of built-in math functions, including an extensive math module, that allows you to perform mathematical tasks on numbers.

              #The min() and max() functions can be used to find the lowest or highest value in an iterable:

#Example
x = min(5, 10, 25)
y = max(5, 10, 25)

print(x)
print(y)


     #The abs() function returns the absolute (positive) value of the specified number:
     
     
#Example
    
x = abs(-7.25)

print(x)


       #The pow(x, y) function returns the value of x to the power of y (xy).

#Example
       
       #Return the value of 4 to the power of 3 (same as 4 * 4 * 4):

x = pow(4, 3)

print(x)


      #The math.sqrt() method for example, returns the square root of a number:

#Example

import math

x = math.sqrt(64)

print(x)
