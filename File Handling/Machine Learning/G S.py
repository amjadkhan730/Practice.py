# Machine Learning

              #Machine Learning is making the computer learn from studying data and statistics.

              #Machine Learn ing is a step into the direction of artificial intelligence (AI).

              #Machine Learning is a program that analyses data and learns to predict the outcome.

#Data Set
#In the mind of a computer, a data set is any collection of data. It can be anything from an array to a complete database.

#Example of an array:

#[99,86,87,88,111,86,103,87,94,78,77,85,86]

#Example of a database:

#Carname	  Color	  Age	 Speed	 AutoPass
 #BMW	      red	   5	  99	   Y
 #Volvo	     black	   7	  86    	Y
 #VW	      gray	   8	  87	    N
 #VW	    white	   7	  88	   Y
 
 
 #Data Types
    
        #To analyze data, it is important to know what type of data we are dealing with.

       #We can split the data types into three main categories:

# 1)Numerical
# 2)Categorical
# 3)Ordinal


  # Numerical =
  # Numerical data are numbers, and can be split into two numerical categories:

# Discrete Data
#- numbers that are limited to integers. Example: The number of cars passing by.

#Continuous Data
#- numbers that are of infinite value. Example: The price of an item, or the size of an item
#Categorical data are values that cannot be measured up against each other. Example: a color value, or any yes/no values.


# Ordinal =
#Ordinal data are like categorical data, but can be measured up against each other. Example: school grades where A is better than B and so on.
